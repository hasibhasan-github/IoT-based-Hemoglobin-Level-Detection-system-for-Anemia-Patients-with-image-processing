# IoT-based-Hemoglobin-Level-Detection-system-for-Anemia-Patients-with-image-processing
This repository contains the code and resources for our research paper titled "IoT-based Hemoglobin Level Detection System for Anemia Patients with Image Processing." Anemia is a widespread health issue, and timely detection of hemoglobin levels is critical for effective patient management. Our research focuses on developing an innovative solution that leverages IoT and image processing techniques to provide a non-invasive method for estimating hemoglobin levels.

The system comprises a mobile application, a cloud platform, and wearable devices equipped with sensors. Users can capture fingertip images using the mobile app, which then undergoes analysis using advanced image processing algorithms deployed on the cloud. These algorithms analyze color intensity and light distribution in the images to estimate hemoglobin levels accurately. The results are displayed to users in real-time through the mobile app.

By providing a non-invasive and convenient method for hemoglobin level detection, our system aims to improve access to healthcare for anemia patients, particularly in resource-limited settings. This repository includes the codebase, documentation, and resources necessary for replicating our research findings and further development in the field of IoT-based healthcare solutions.
